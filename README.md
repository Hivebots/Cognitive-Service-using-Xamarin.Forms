# Microsoft Cognitive Services Vision API with Xamarin.Forms

### Description
In this demo, you will use one of the [Microsoft Cognitive Services API's](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/) to bring intelligence to a Xamarin.Forms application.

The first goal is to use the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api) to get your emotion after taking a picture of yourself with the device/emulator camera.

The second goal is to use the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api) to get a description after taking a picture of an object with the device/emulator camera.

We can analyze our photo and see what celebrity we look like and analyze the text of an image.

The walkthrough below should help you, but you can also get in touch with me [@Wilson_VargasM](https://twitter.com/Wilson_VargasM)  I will be happy to help!

This demo requires either:

- Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 (with Xamarin tools installed)
- Xamarin Studio with either an Android or iOS phone
